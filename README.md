# A Guessing Game
You'll be asked to pick a number in your mind between a given range. A set of numbers will be displayed and you have to tell if the number you picked in your mind is present here or not.
The game will automatically guess the number in your head with 100% accuracy after passing a few steps.

The algorithm is written in both C and Python and later was implemented in visual studio using C++.

This is something I had to build during univeristy period as a freshman project.
